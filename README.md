# Coordinated Factor Analysis (CFA)

This is an implementation of the Coordinated Factor Analysis (CFA) algorithm or also known as globally coordinated mixture of factor analysers.

Three demonstrative examples are provided including a portion of the benchmark SwissRoll data set, a 2D plane of data curved in 3D with sinusoidal signal, human motion capture data of a walking cycle. An interactive figure is used to show mapping from latent variable space to the data space.

Please refer to the following article for more details as the code is a subset of this study
